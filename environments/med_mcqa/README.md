# MEDMCQA

Evaluation environment for the MEDMCQA dataset.

## Overview
- **Environment ID:** `med_mcqa`
- **Short description:** Single-turn medical multiple-choice QA
- **Tags:** medical, single-turn, multiple-choice, train, eval

## Datasets
- **Primary dataset(s):** MedMCQA (HF datasets)
- **Source links:** [lighteval/med_mcqa](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lighteval/med_mcqa)
- **Split sizes:** Uses provided train and validation splits

## Task
- **Type:** Single-turn
- **Parser:** `Parser` (standard) or `ThinkParser` (if using reasoning mode) depending on `use_think`
- **Rubric overview:** Binary scoring (1.0 / 0.0), based on correct letter or answer text match.  
- **Reward function:** `accuracy` — returns 1.0 if the predicted answer matches, else 0.0.

## Model Input Format
Each example is formatted as a single-turn user message: 

```
Give a letter answer among A, B, C or D.
Question: {question}
A. {opa}
B. {opb}
C. {opc}
D. {opd}
Answer:
```

The model should respond with a letter choice (A–D).

## Quickstart
Run an evaluation with default settings:

```bash
prime eval run med_mcqa -m "openai/gpt-5-mini" -n 5 -s
```

## Usage
To run an evaluation using `medarc-eval` with the OpenAI API:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
medarc-eval med_mcqa -m "openai/gpt-5-mini" -n 5 -s

# Shuffled-answers example (seed 1618), with one change from defaults (`--use-think`).
medarc-eval med_mcqa -m "openai/gpt-5-mini" -n 5 -s --shuffle-answers --shuffle-seed 1618 --use-think
```
Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

## PRIME-RL Training
Use this under your PRIME-RL config's `[[orchestrator.env]]` section.

```toml
[[orchestrator.env]]
id = "med_mcqa"
name = "med_mcqa"
args = { use_think = true, train_answer_formats = "random", training_shuffle_answers = true, training_seed = 23 }
```

Training notes:
- `training_shuffle_answers = true` reshuffles answer order at rollout time for train rows only.
- The stored training dataset remains stable; repeated RL presentations of the same row may use different answer orders.
- Eval rows remain fixed unless `shuffle_answers = true` is explicitly enabled.
- `training_seed` controls training answer-format routing. Rollout-time train reshuffling itself is stochastic.

  abstract = 	 {This paper introduces MedMCQA, a new large-scale, Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) dataset designed to address real-world medical entrance exam questions. More than 194k high-quality AIIMS & NEET PG entrance exam MCQs covering 2.4k healthcare topics and 21 medical subjects are collected with an average token length of 12.77 and high topical diversity. Each sample contains a question, correct answer(s), and other options which requires a deeper language understanding as it tests the 10+ reasoning abilities of a model across a wide range of medical subjects & topics. A detailed explanation of the solution, along with the above information, is provided in this study.}
